# Burger-Builder
Built a Burger building single page web application with the use of React Js

Steps to run the project-

1) Download all the files in a single folder
2) Run "npm install" in the download folder
3) Run "npm start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.
